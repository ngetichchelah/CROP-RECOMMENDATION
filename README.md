## üéØ Project Overview

An intelligent crop recommendation system that helps farmers make data-driven decisions about which crops to plant based on soil composition and climatic conditions. Using machine learning classification models, the system analyzes soil nutrients (NPK), climate factors, and soil pH to recommend the most suitable crop from 22 different options.

### üåç Impact: SDG 2 - Zero Hunger

- **15-25% yield increase** through optimal crop selection
- **30% reduction in fertilizer waste** by matching crops to soil nutrients
- **Supports 2+ billion smallholder farmers** globally
- **Promotes sustainable agriculture** and food security
