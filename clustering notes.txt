Agricultural domain knowledge tells us crops naturally fall into 5 functional groups

Group 1: Nitrogen-Fixing Legumes 

Crops: chickpea, lentil, kidneybeans, mothbeans, pigeonpeas, blackgram, mungbean
Characteristic: LOW nitrogen needs (20-50 kg/ha)
Why separate: They ADD nitrogen to soil (40-80 kg/ha through root nodules)
Agricultural value: Plant these FIRST in rotation to enrich soil
Real-world use: "Which crops improve my soil?"

Group 2: Heavy Feeders (Cash Crops) 

Crops: cotton, jute, coffee
Characteristic: VERY HIGH nitrogen needs (>80 kg/ha)
Why separate: They DEPLETE soil nitrogen rapidly
Agricultural value: Plant AFTER legumes to utilize added nitrogen
Real-world use: "Which crops need the most fertilizer?"

Group 3: Water-Intensive Tropicals 

Crops: rice, banana, papaya, coconut
Characteristic: HIGH rainfall needs (>200mm)
Why separate: Require irrigation in dry regions OR monsoon climate
Agricultural value: Don't recommend these in drought-prone areas
Real-world use: "Which crops survive with little water?"

Group 4: Drought-Tolerant Crops 

Crops: groundnuts, mothbeans (overlap with legumes)
Characteristic: LOW rainfall tolerance (<80mm)
Why separate: Can survive arid conditions
Agricultural value: Recommend for Makueni-type bare lands
Real-world use: "What can I grow in dry conditions?"

Group 5: Balanced/Versatile Crops 

Crops: maize, fruits (apple, grapes, mango, orange, pomegranate, watermelon, muskmelon)
Characteristic: MODERATE requirements across all parameters
Why separate: Suitable for average soils, no extreme needs
Agricultural value: Safe recommendations for most farmers
Real-world use: "What grows in normal conditions?"
