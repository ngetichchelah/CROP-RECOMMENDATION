IN ERROR ANALYSIS:
Questions to ask:

1. Which crops have the most errors?
2. Are errors clustered at specific nutrient/climate ranges?
3. What's the average confidence on errors vs correct predictions?

Critical Observations:
1. Two Crops Dominate Errors:
Groundnuts: 58 errors (48.7% of all errors)
Mothbeans: 46 errors (38.7% of all errors)
Together: 87.4% of all errors!
2. Groundnuts ↔ Mothbeans Confusion:
They're being confused with each other constantly
Model can't distinguish between them well
3. Confidence Pattern is STRONG:
High confidence (>85%): 99.40% accuracy ✅
Low confidence (50-70%): 40% accuracy ❌
Clear reliability indicator!
4. Sample Errors Show:
All 10 examples involve groundnuts/mothbeans confusion
Low to medium confidence (34-68%)
Model is "uncertain" about these cases


Reviewing the error analysis chart:
** Key observations: **
1. Is there a clear relationship between confidence and accuracy?
2. What confidence threshold should we use for production? (e.g., reject predictions <70%)

LEARNING CURVES ANALYSIS
Learning curves show:
1.How model performance changes with training data size (Learning Curve)
2.Training vs Validation performance (Overfitting/Underfitting detection)
3.Per-crop learning behavior
